1.      Java:= java is a object oriented programing language, java is a high compatible language.
	 it as platform independent because WORE (Write once run anywhere) bcz once it will run it convert into byte code then it will run anywhere. 
	bcz it is platform independent.it is a high level language
 
	Javac:= Javac is compile the .java code..it will compile the code ..also it is a compiler.

2	JDK:= JDK-Java Development Kit= it contains a tools and JRE .It can both write and wxecutein java.
	JRE:= JRE-Java RunTime Environment=it contains as libraries and JVM. It can only Execute the code.
	JVM:= JVM-Java Virtual machine = it as execute the byte code after compiler will comipile the code. it as only Execute the code.

3	.java:= it is used to java code that used to compile the java code and it as the extention of file name .java
 	.class file:= it is copiled code after compiler will be comiled this code it will automatically converted into .java file

4	java IDE,s it is the platform will execute java code, it is the software platform will execute the java code or progarm
	it stands for integrated development edition

5	Variables:= Variables are using in java it can be used to store data  or values  
	 		In variables 2 type class level and method level
			class level= Static and non Static 
			Method level=Local and Parameter

6	Object oriented programming language because we can use real time objects ,.
	object is a real time entity.objects are used to storing data in the form of datatype.
	This laguage is depend on the objects perticularly real time objects or entities

7	class x workz{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		
	}
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		
	}
	}

	It comes an Error because we can't declare a main method at a time in one class ,Already declared

8	Data type is a form of storing the data or information using the data type
		it as 2 types 
		1: Primitive =Int ,float,char,double ,long ,byte,short,boolean
		2: non Primitive= String and all Class Names 

9	Dot Operator is using to concatinating the 2 Strings
    	in instance veriable we using the dot operator
	eg: this.name=name;    it means accessing the instace variable with the local variable

10	Java Feature
  	1.Polymorphism
	2.Abstraction
	3.Encapsulation
	4.Inheritance

11	Array:=Array is the collection of items it can used to storing more data in the one frame
	It has been declared in the inside the Square brace
	Eg: int[] number=[12,3,5,6];
	
12 	class :=calss is a Keyword it is used to invoke method and variables 
	object:= object is a real time entity.objects are used to storing data in the form of datatype.
		an instance of a Java class, meaning it is a copy of a specific class.
	Eg : for obj is======Course course=new Course();
	Eg: for class======
	    class Course
            { 
		int name;
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
                	System.out.println("Name"+name);
           	}
	    }

13  	Keywords: keywords are given by the language.it as been predefined.already a default value given by the language
	10 Keywords:1.Int 
		    2.float
		    3.char
		    4.double 
		    5.long 
		    6.byte
		    7.short
		    8.boolean
	            9.if
 		   10.else,do,while,for,this,super,static etc

14	Costructor : Constructor is a special Method
		     It as no return type
		     Same as class name	
                     initiat instance variable	
		
         types: default and parametaraized constructor

15	Main method is static because it as it can accese static rather than non static it can only be the display part.
	types it as Static and non static method types,Jvm is only works on a static at the time of execute it will find first main static

16   
	class Number
	{
             public static void main(String[] args)
             {
		int[] num={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
		for(int i=0;i<num.length;i++)
		{
			System.out.println(num[i]);
		}
		System.out.println("Length of the array given in the list is:"+num.length);
             }
	}

17	Method :Method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the resulr to caller.It can perform task without returning anythig.
		A method is like a function and it is used to expose behavior of an object 
		It is a set codes that perform a particular task
                Eg: static void setcouse(String name)
			{
                            Course.name=name;
			}
        Method Overloading: class as multiple methods having same name but different parameter
		Eg: void setPlace(String name,int pincode)
			{
				this.name=name;
				this.pincode=pincode;
			}
